                <h2 class="project-title">MathAR</h2>
                <p class="project-dsc">This is an application I adapted for my master thesis. Previously this AR application was created to support children while they learn about buidling blocks.
                    This is commonly done in schools by using real blocks or drawings of buildings, so it was interesting to see if an AR application sould support children to the same or potentially even a higher degree.
                    As is often the case however, some drawbacks were found and the results were inconclusive. I was therefore tasked to add an element to the application that would make it more interactive.
                    Together we settled on Feedback and in turn also on the adoption of a learning task as a viable way to create something more of a learning environment. 
                    While the results for learning were still inconclusive, I can proudly say that the adaptations added were not only fun for the children to interact with, the high usability score it received made me really proud as well.

                <p class="project-dsc">A project created for the "Game Design" Module during my masters degree. Together with two classmates we came up with the idea for a game
                    where children can learn basic and later on advanced math principles. The goal was to create a game that can be played together where both children have to
                    not only solve the platforming challenge (hoping that that would add an element of fun), but also consider what numbers and mathematical operations
                    to collect in their arsenal to create the final number that would unlock the door to the next level. While my classmates dealt with the documentation and 
                    learning research elements of the game, the coding was left primarily to me. As the module lasted only a couple of weeks, we only had to code the first level.

                    quiz on what plant (out of a database of selected plants) would fit their criteria the best and then be able to see the results of their quiz on a homepage.
                    I received a positive grade for this project and it thaught me a lot about the creation of websites which I really enjoyed.

                <p class="project-dsc">For another project the task was to create a learning module for a specific given topic. As my group's topic turned out to be gamification, 
                    we thought it would be fun to create an actual game that would teach the player about gamification concepts. And so the idea of a point-and-click adventure was born.
                    Since we were four people, we divided the parts of the project equally. Not only did we receive a good grade, but our classmates stayed longer in class (by their own volition) to finish
                    the gameplay as they were enjoying their time.

                <p class="project-dsc">One of the more challenging projects was the creation of an interactive device that would tell you about the conditions
                    that your plant was in. Using multiple sensors such as a light sensor, a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor, we created a device consisting of
                    multiple little lamps that would indicate the state that your plant was in. If the middle lamp would burn, this would mean that the conditions
                    were just right. This project definitely was one of the more challenging ones as I am less familiar with hardware than with software.

                <p class="project-dsc">For the "Human Computer Interaction" module, our task was to design the mockup for an application that would
                    allow university students to not only keep track of their classes, but also to socialize with other students. This app would show
                     the students calendar on their homepage and they could then subscribe not only to class related events such as groups created
                      by their professors (to keep up to date on course work), but also to social events such as parties or other events that would be happening in the area.
                     This project was primarily teaching us about how to best design an application that would be user friendly and easy to navigate. Again, this
                     was a module, I enjoyed a lot.

                    As such my goals were to find the best possible application environment that could handle the task and implement the solution. I have to admit that I do not remember much
                    about this project and that it being my first thesis (created during the pandemic nonetheless) it was not my best work. I am still
                    really glad that I made it happen and how much I learned during that whole process.
